# hello-world
This is a repository meant to help me learn the basics of HTML coding and showcase those skills by creating a basic website.
I will add new pages and more complex elements to the website as I learn more of the language and what all it can do.
One day I hope to be a software developer for a gaming company such as Blizzard or Tarsier Studios (the creators of Little Nightmares).
